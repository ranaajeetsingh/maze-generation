# maze-generation
Maze data generated with selectable algorithms, starting from simple to complex.

The first algorithm implemented will be Randomized Depth-First Search, or "Recursive Backtracker".
Information on it can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm

Tutorials and more that I have found and tried to base my code off of include:
